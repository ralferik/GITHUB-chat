# üè¶ Princess Sofia's Casino - Client-Server Communication

This project implements a **TCP-based client-server communication** system where multiple clients can connect to a server, exchange messages, and receive responses. The server handles multiple clients concurrently, logs their IP addresses and ports, and supports message broadcasting.

---

## üöÄ Features (currently operating)

- **Multi-client support**: Multiple clients can connect to the server at the same time.
- **Server-side logging**: Logs each connected client's IP and port.
- **Client-server messaging**: Clients receive a welcome message and can send messages to the server.
- **Message broadcasting**: The server echoes messages back to other clients.
- **Graceful disconnection handling**: When a client disconnects, the server removes it from the active list.
- **Multi-player functionality**: Our game can support at least 2 players.
